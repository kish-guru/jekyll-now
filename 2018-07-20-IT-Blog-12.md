This week in IT, we made our names in Python with Turtleâ€¦ but they had to be 3D. I attempted doing this off the top off my head and kept trying by correcting any errors i saw by running the program multiple times. However, doing this off the top of my head was proving to be very hard so I searched an images of the 3D letters I needed and began again. This lesson was quite tough but very enjoyable as you had to calculate what angles evrything had to be and all the lengths had to be equal.
