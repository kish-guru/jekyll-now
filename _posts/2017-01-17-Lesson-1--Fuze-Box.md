    <td>I learnt how to set up my website (again!). At first I thought I could use last year's blog and change some aspects of it. It was going well until I accidentally deleted all my posts and posts section of my github which meant I couldn’t post any more using that repository. I even went on to Docs and tried to post but it wouldn’t let me so I deleted my old repository and all that hard work I spent changing my old blog was gone along with my blog. After deleting my old repository, I went on to Google classroom and followed the steps my teacher posted like I was a new student and it worked! That is why you are reading this. Being resilient and not giving up definitely helped because if I didn’t then I wouldn’t have learnt as much. Setting up the Fuze box was much easier as my teacher had shown me how to do it at the start and I also had a partner to help me out. Throughout the lesson, my partner and I went through a few pages from the Fuze Box book and we learnt how to do some amazing things. For example, we got it to say "Hello World" continuously without stopping. Again, we were resilient so when some things didn’t work we tried again. At the end we saved our worked onto our memory sticks. </td>

    <td>There was one problem at the start that definitely slowed down me and my partner. Half of the equipment we got weren’t working and that was just unlucky. Our Fuze Box wasn’t turning on and our monitor was connected properly so we got a new Fuze Box and we push in all the cables firmly. Then it worked! I also need to work on not asking the teacher for everything.</td>

    <td>Next lesson I will make sure I get on with the Fuze Box quicker and I will make sure my github blog is legible. I will also try and ask less questions next lesson. I will also set up my Fuze Box quicker.</td>
