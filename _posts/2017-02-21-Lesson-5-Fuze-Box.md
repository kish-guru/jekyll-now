    <td>This time I was the typer for most of the lesson as my partner had done a lot while I was away. He read the code -specifying whether the letters are capitals or not or whether there is a space- and typed whatever he said. Halfway through I discovered a strategy. All of the main code was in capitals so I kept Caps lock on for most of it. This enabled me to type faster and also knowing that capitals in speech marks don't mess up your code really helped because I barely needed to change from Caps on to off. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To be honest, I think we worked pretty hard that lesson but there were times where I switched off and did something idiotic. For example, my partner said space (meaning, press the spacebar) but I accidentally typed SPACE in. In addition, when we tested our code, we found out there were silly mistakes made and that slowed us down because we had to go back and sort it out.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will not switch off for a second at times and I will try and type a bit faster and better(not making typing mistakes) because it makes get through more work and we get to see the results of our code work.</td>
