    <td>For just a bit more than half of this lesson we were checking last week's work, finishing off some bits of last week’s code and trying to make it work. We spent a long time trying to make it work because he Fuze box kept telling us that there was an error on a line but when we checked that line, it turned out that line was right. We tried different commandments on that line but it still didn’t work. At this point we were thinking of moving on ut then we found a few mistakes on other lines(not the line the Fuze box was telling us). It turns out that when I was typing the code out, I put it in extra spaces which weren’t to be there. Our strategy to making out code work was perseverance.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The fact that the computer told us the wrong thing limited my learning because the actual error was on a different line. However, if the Fuze box box told us the right thing then we would have saved around 25 mins. Also we were slow when making decisions about this problems and we made stupid ones sometimes. For example, we tried the same change a few times when we knew that it didn’t work the first time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time we will be more accurate with our code(especially when I am typing). We will also check the other lines around the error line the computer says just in case the error isn’t where the computer says it is.</td>
