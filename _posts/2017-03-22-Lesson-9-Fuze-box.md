    <td>We struggled for most of the lesson because we did what the book told us to do but it still didn't work. There was a picture of the setup of the electronics but we decided to follow the instructions and that was what messed us up. We tried the code on two different modes and we also switched the wires round. However, in the end perseverance helped because, one of the switch arounds(which was similar to the picture) actually worked and my partner and I were really happy. The code worked as well. There was new code which made the light turn off and that worked too! We were going to try and make it flash but we ran out of time so we will do it next week. We took a picture of what we did! </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Some of the things the book told us didn’t work so we had to do things ourselves. In addition, the pictures that were meant to guide us were a bit confusing so this slowed us down a bit. If I tried the different ways out quicker then I think I would have been able to get more work done but it was just the start so I think I did quite well.</td>

    <td>If we are stuck next week then I will try out different ways much quicker so we can get some work done. At a point, I was really close to giving up so but I didn’t and I won't do that next time. Also, if the book is right then I will look at the book carefully.</td>
