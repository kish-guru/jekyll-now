    <td>The started off with the teacher explaining that even if you learn all the words in a language, you still can't hold a conversation. I agreed with his point straight away. Then he told us that what we were going to doing in code academy is learning the words of code.  In the lesson I learnt about variables, data types(boolean and numbers), comments, arithmetic operations and whitespace. Then I had to complete lesson which tested me on all of this. I then began to start a new lesson o Strings and Console input. So far I have only really learnt the strings part but for homework, which is 30 mins of codeacademy, I am going to try and finish the whole lesson.</td>

    <td>Next time I will make sure my typing is correct and I might even check each time I finish one line of coding just to be safe and not make stupid errors again.</td>
