    <td>Today I finished off the strings and Console output and learnt how to find out exactly what time, date and year it is. I began the conditionals and flow section today and I am a quarter of the way through so you could say that I am over 19 % through the whole thing because the percentage only updates once you have finished a lesson.  I worked pretty hard today so I think the strategy was to stay focused and type. </td>

    <td>I did tend to wander off my work and look at people's today and that is what slowed me down. However, half of time I was helping my friend out.</td>

    <td>Next time I will not try to wander off and if my friend needs help then I will let him try himself for a bit more time because he might work it out himself.</td>
