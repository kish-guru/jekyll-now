    <td>I started on on last part of Conditionals and Control Flow and when I finished I moved on to the next section Pyg Latin. The aim of this lesson was to get a working Pig Latin translator which is basically where the first letter of the word you type in moves to the end and "ay" is added on. For example, Football becomes “ootballfay”. Throughout the lesson, the person who was sitting next to me was on the same stage I was and there was this one part where we both got stuck on. We spent around 10mins just trying different things but we couldn't figure it out. Then my teacher showed it to me and explained to me which made me really annoyed because it was something simple.</td>
