    <td>In the lesson I went got to halfway of the first part of functions and I learnt about defining a function and how a function takes in arguments. I realised that functions worked when you called them using their arguments. I was told to do 2 hours of Codeacademy for the Half-Term and I had to keep note of the when and for how long I did some work because we had to split the 2 hours into chunks and we had three weeks to do it. I did not do any Codeacademy for a week and a half as we had exams in the first week. Here is a list of what days I did coding and for how long:
26th May=19:10-19:30(20 mins)28th May=17:10-17:25(15 mins)
29th May=20:05-20:30(25 mins)
30th May=16:10-16:30(20 mins)
2nd June=19:40-20:00(20 mins)
3rd June=19:25-19:45(20 mins)
When I began doing my work, I had forgotten some parts about functions so went back through functions and that lasted about 10 mins but I didn't count that. After looking back, I did 20 mins of work. In this carried on with functions and I learnt how to import from the math module. I got shown many different ways how to do it but in the end I did what they recommended in the hint. I finished the first part of functions in that first session.  For all of the other session ,except for the last 2, I did the second part of functions which was "Taking a vacation" and it involved planning a trip. I wrote code that worked out the cost of the place you had to stay in, the cost of renting a car, the cost of the plane.
In the last 2 sessions I did Python Lists and Dictionaries. I fished Lists in the last session and began dictionaries so I will continue with dictionaries in the next lesson.
