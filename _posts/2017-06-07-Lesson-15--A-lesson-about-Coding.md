    <td>In this week's lesson I learnt about how specific you have to be when you write code. My class was told to come up with the steps to making a tea and we did. After that we got rid of the other steps except for the first one which was "Fill the kettle with water". For a human that is normal and we would know exactly what to do but if it was a computer/ robot arm then it would ask a lot of questions. For example, “How full does the kettle have to be?” Or “ Do I have to take the lid off?”. A computer would ask questions and not do things that are very obvious to us. So we were told not to make assumptions about computers. Then we were told to stand up and sit down slowly and notice what body we were using to do this. There were many. It is the same with computers but the many body parts is replaced by many languages. Basically, Python is at the top of the ladder and if we ask the computer to do something it starts off with 1s and 0s and then translates it to another coding language which then translates it to another and so on. It keeps translating until we get to Python and when it gets to Python, it will know what to do in Python. Python wouldn’t know what to do if told it to do something using 1s and 0s. Something very simple also requires this process. Anyway, the main learning point of this lesson was to not make assumptions when writing code.</td>
