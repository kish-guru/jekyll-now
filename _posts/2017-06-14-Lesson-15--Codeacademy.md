    <td>I began the lesson on " Lists and Dictionaries” I learnt how to add new name and values to dictionaries as they can be changed just like lists. This also meant that they could be deleted and they can be given new definitions or values. You can remove things from lists too.
I spent quite a while on the exercise after that. I spent about 25-30 mins on that exercise. In the end  I realised that you have mention the dictionary or list before you type in remove or add anything to the list or dictionary. I also realised that I had put in an extra letter which i shouldn't have and that was a careless mistake. However, I wouldn't have figured it out if it weren’t for my friend pointing out that I forgot to before doing anything to it.After I finished it, I moved onto the next section which was,  "a day at the supermarket”.</td>

    <td>Next week I shall make sure I don’t make spelling mistakes and if I am stuck and I am really stuck, then before I ask someone I will probably go through what I did in the previous exercises.</td>
