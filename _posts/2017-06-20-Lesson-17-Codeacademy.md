    <td>I began the lesson by trying to find the total costs of many fruits. I struggled to do this because the code involved two keys and I asked my teacher what was wrong. He told me that I wasn't using the keys in the code. He told me how to write the code without confusing the computer about which key I was using. In the end, I worked it out. Then I had to work out the total cost of foods in  a list. I struggled with this because I didn’t know the difference between when two symbols were used and when one symbol was used but then I got told that when two sybols are used, we are asking the computer a question.</td>
