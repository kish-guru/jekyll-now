    <td>I struggled on the first codecademy lesson of the actual lesson because I accidentally gave different code the same variable name. I was stuck for a while when I realised that I had repeated it and I was quite annoyed. Then I moved onto next lesson where you had work out the grades for marks and I did that quite quickly. The one mistake I made was when I forget write the symbol for bigger than and equal to. I worked out the code for the next lesson quite quickly as well but I had to finish it off at home.</td>
