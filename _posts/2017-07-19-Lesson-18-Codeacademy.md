    <td>I began the lesson on a very hard challenge. I was stuck on it for about ten minutes.It was the last part if "Student becomes teacher" and you had to work out the average of the class and grade of the class. I was stuck on it because what I wrote did what it asked:the average of the class and the grade. However, for some reason it didn't like it so I went on the q and forum and compared other people’s answers to mine. I changed some parts and it worked. It did exactly the same thing but it was different code. The next lesson was Lists and Functions and I stormed through the first exercises as they were little changes or code I had to do. But then I got stuck on a lesson that was easy but I just couldn’t figure my way around it. I went on the q and q forum again and I realised that my code was so close and I just I to changed a few things.</td>
