This year in IT was quite an interesting year because we never the usual lesson where the teacher explains something and after that we have to go do some work. For half of the year we had to work by ourselves and figure out problems independently. In the other half we worked in twos. In this year I have learnt a lot about coding itself, especially in Python. For example, I have learnt how accurate you must be and that everything in your code has to be right because the computer won't correct it for you. This year IT has helped to increase to the amount of time I keep trying for because this year I have definitely tried more at things I keep getting wrong. Out of everything that has stuck in my head this year in IT, the one message that I will always remember is that IT is just for people that want to have jobs that focus on computing, it is for everyone because we are growing up into a world where technology is everywhere.
