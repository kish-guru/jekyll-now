In this lesson of It we learnt about discounts. A situation we need this skill is for when sales take place. The way to discount a certain total is to tell the computer to minus the discount percentage from a hundred; then divide it by a hundred to make it a decimal. Then you tell the computer to times the sum total by the decimal to give you the final total. However, the problem with this was that you always got a discount whenever you bought anything and that isn't really good for business. Therefore, we learnt how to tell the computer to make the discount only when a certain amount of items have been purchased so if you buy one less than the item required then you don’t get a discount. This is done by telling them computer to only do the discount IF the amount of items purchased is greater or equal to the amount of items required for the discount. Using this procedure, you can make deals like 'buy one get one free’.
