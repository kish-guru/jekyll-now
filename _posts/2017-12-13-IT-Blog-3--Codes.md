Our usual teacher,Mr.Tansley, wasn't hear this week,unfortunately, and so we had to have a cover. Our work was set on Google classroom and it involved doing discounts(again). However, this time instead just practising what we did last week, we had been challenged to involve codes(like a voucher) that gave an extra discount. What I first tried to do was install a discount code column and in that column I listed the codes that would give discounts. Then I changed one of the cell below the full price cell into "Discount code given". Nex, on the cell next to it I said that if the number in that cell was the same as a number in the column full of codes then take 20% off but that didn't work and I ended up just making one discount code work. I really struggled that lesson but I still went away learning something.
