This week it was all about improving our blog and so that is exactly what I did. As I didn't want delete my repository from last year, I decided to just delete all my posts from last year instead and this took a while as you couldn’t select all of them a once to delete them. After I did this, I changed my background( and it took me a while to work out how). We were also taught how to embed our Virtual shop and you did this by copying the iframe link and pasting it into your posts. I couldn’t figure how to do it so my friend helped me out. In addition, we had a quick look at our Virtual shop but we didn’t have enough time to add something new.
