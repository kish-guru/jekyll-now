In my first lesson of IT learnt a lot. Firstly, I found out that we were going to spreadsheet work for the rest of our time in IT with Mr.Tansley and that spreadsheet work will come in our lives at least once. For example, Mr.Tansley is mainly a music teacher but he told us that he did spreadsheet work 3 or 4 times when he was at university. The first thing I learnt in the lesson was how to multiply the price of something with a quantity to get a total price but then we realised that there was a chance of making many mistakes which would cost you some money if you were a businessman. Therefore we learnt how to make the computer to only select items  that exist in the stock list and then used our knowledge of multiplying prices with quantity to make ,almost, a catalogue. Finally, we were told how to add up all the prices to bet a total amount.
