Recapping is the word I would use to describe his lesson because that was all we did. We didn't do any extra work on our virtual shop and we didnâ€™t add to our blogs. We discussed how the computer likes things numerically or alphabetically so the conclusion was that if we just put our items in without telling it to forget about any type of order, then everything would go wrong. As a result we have to put the word ,false, after we tell the computer to Vertically Lookup (Vlookup). Vlookup is where we told the computer to look up anything in column A:B and display it on the cell. Also, the way to do discounts is by getting the discount percentage dividing it by a 100 and then minusing it from one. Then to get the discount price you had to times the full price by the decimal discount number.
