Up to this point it was all about about how much money we would would get with no subtractions or anything. This lesson, we thought about how our shops would work in real life. By this I mean, we learnt about how much profit we would get if these factors were involved: rent of my home, advertising, how much I bought products for, paying employees ,upping prices for things that sell a lot and reducing the number of stock for products that have a low chance of selling. Taking all of this into consideration, we worked out how much profit we would make in a year and it turned out that the prices I gave for certain products weren't enough as I didnâ€™t make much profit at all in year. Therefore, I changed the prices of those products.
