This week we learnt about secret messaging and how to send messages in a certain code. The lesson started with everyone being given the task of solving a coded message. Quite a lot of people worked it out but I struggled quite a bit. When I found what the code was I was kicking myself because all it was, was that the letters of the message had just been moved back one letter on the alphabet. We were then told to make a coding system ourselves which quite a few people struggled on but in fact, it needed something that we had done already:Vlookup. Once you coded one cell all you had to do was drag it onto the others and bang! It worked! Deciphering it was our next task but that was easy because all you had to do was switch the letters of the Vlookup round.
