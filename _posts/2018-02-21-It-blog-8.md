Binary. This is what computers use to function.it has two options:1 which is on and 2 which is off. All keys on the keyboard have a binary code so that when we press the key, the computer processes the code and makes the letter pop up on our screen. Our first task was to find the ASCII coding for all or most of the keys on the keyboard. Most people actually struggled with this and our teacher ended up telling us where to find it. Once we found it, we imported it to our sheets and we found out that some of the binary coding did not have 8 digits( the standard number of digits binary should have) so we were told how to do put in at the start of any coding that didn't have 8 digits. We were showed how to make a binary translator. Again, this involved the Vlookup function. Once we had coded one cell, we just dragged the code onto the other cells. The final problem we faced was that each binary code for each letter of our word was in its own individual cell. Therefore we used the CONCATENATE function and it was all then joined up in one cell!
