Unfortunately, our spreadsheets work has finished and now we have moved on to "Python with turtle" on a website called repl.it. We began by discussing how a computer would draw a shape. It does not know what forward or downward or upwards, etc is. However, it does know what direction it is going in. So we started our coding in Python off by telling the turtle to travel in its direction for a length of “120”. Then we told it to turn 90 degrees and so on until it finished a square. There was a problem with this. We didn't know the exterior angles of all the shapes in the world from the top of our heads so we were then told to think about how we could do it without the angle variable. To do this we did all the same code but in the brackets where the angle number is meant to to go we insert: 360/sides. As a result all we had to do after words was tell the computer what the number of sides was and the length. We were then asked to figure out how to draw multiple shapes with just one extra line of code. Everyone struggled on this and our teacher ended up showing us. Our homework was to create a pattern using the code we learnt this week.
