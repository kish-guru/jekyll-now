IT this week was all about making a machine to find prime numbers. We were given 2 minutes to come up with some sort of code and we ended up going over the time given. 

However, most of us ended up completing some sort of working code. I was just two speech marks off. We then went through some logic to help us make our machines. For example, it can't be an even number and the number had to be a whole number. Using this logic, we made a better machine.
