We moved away from Python with Turtle this week and focused on Python. We started off by looking at a few chatbots on the internet. Mitsuku was the best one as it responded just like a human would've in all of the questions we asked it.

We then began making own chatbots- well… not really. We coded one question and this involved the code "input" which allows the person answering the computer's question to type and “==“ which symbolises a question.”If” commands were also used which allows the computer to respond to our answers. Once we coded it the first time, we noticed a few problems: the computer would say “error”when we said something wasn’t coded in and it didn’t understand capital letters. Therefore, we typed in a “.lower” command and also told it to say “I don’T understand when an answer not in the code was said. To code all of this we also had to use a “while True” loop for the computer to keep asking the question and then “break” once answered correctly. After this we created our own questions.
